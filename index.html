    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
        <p>Hi, I'm Badugula Sindhu Reddy, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Kansas with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and software development. I have over a year of experience as a Software Engineer at Niq, where I worked on developing scalable software solutions and improving system performance.

            Currently, I am pursuing my Master's and focusing on projects that involve AI, machine learning, and geospatial technologies. One of my ongoing projects is a geofencing initiative, where I am exploring the use of geospatial data and algorithms to create virtual boundaries for tracking and monitoring.
            
            My academic background, combined with hands-on industry experience, has equipped me with the skills to solve complex problems and innovate in the fields of AI and geospatial computing. I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve, particularly in the areas of autonomous systems, machine learning, and real-time data processing.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Project 1: Predicting Physical Exercise Adherence in Fitness Apps using Deep Learning Approach</h3>
        <p>Collaborated with a team of three to predict fourth-month workout sessions using an LSTM deep learning model, classifying users as adherent or non-adherent with K-Means Clustering.
            Designed a user-friendly UI with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to visualize results through graphs and charts, implementing a feedback loop for dynamic user profile updates based on new session data</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Project 2: Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiments and Opinions on Twitter</h3>
        <p>Collaborated in a team of three to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets using VADER and TextBlob.
            Employed a data collection strategy that included web scraping and the Twitter API, and implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) for sentiment analysis, achieving superior results over other algorithms.
            The project aimed to provide actionable insights for healthcare organizations and policymakers during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.</p>
